# desktopcleaner
This is a simple macOS desktop cleaner for all our OCD'ers

For the people that don't like to read, you can watch this loom video on how to use this desktop cleaner:

To use this desktop cleaner make sure you have Python 3 installed on your mac.

To start:

1. Create a file on the desktop and give it a name (this is going to be your file where all the files/folders will go to)
2. Add the name for your main desktop file into line 29 of the code (change 'Deski' to your own file name)
3. Create the following folders in your desktop file: 'Screenshots', 'Docs', 'Images', 'PDF', 'Random'.
4. Run the code, install all apps necessary when given errors.
